# ElysiumCore
an old core i started a year or 2 back, the most recent i worked on this core was like 7/6/24 wont be using it anymore, i dont recommend using the zip bomb for production, do what u want with this.

this has custom enchantments (mediocre, decided to make a "better" seperate plugin and decided to base it off AdvancedEnchantments. that plugin is alr uploaded but not finished.), bragging [item] and [brag] iirc, one shows the item the other the inventory, incursions (my own idea), regions, scorehud tags, key crates, quests, enchantment fragments (items that when applied to gear/tools itll enchant with vanilla enchantments.), home system with max home increasers, bosses, titles, lootboxes, drop packages, premade kits, premade titles, crate previews, and more.
